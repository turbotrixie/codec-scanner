# codec-scanner
Python3/mediainfo scanner to find DTS/Eac3 files in defined folder recursively with multiprocessing

Asks input folder and will scan videofiles recursively to find both Eac3 and DTS files, output results on screen and save in output.txt. Both will show number of hits on said codecs. 

KISS
